 * Just like setup() and loop(), getDistance() here is a function. However, it doesn't run
 * automatically like setup() and loop() do. You need to "call" the function to run it, either
 * from setup() or loop(). In fact, things like pinMode() and digitalWrite() and delay(), that we've been using,
 * are functions. We'll call a function like getDistance in a similar way to how we call pinMode()
 * and digitalWrite() - using its name followed by an opening parentheses, the function's inputs,
 * and closing parentheses. In this case, getDistance requires no input, so we just call it like this -
 * 
 * getDistance();
 * 
 * In loop(), we'll see how to get the result that this function gives us back.
 * 
 * Generally, we make seperate functions like this in order to put some code that may be
 * complicated or very low-level, so that we don't have to worry about it again.
